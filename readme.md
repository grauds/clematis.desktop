## Introduction

jWorkspace is a pet project started back in 1999 and being developed at spare time. It includes 
and is build upon Kiwi and Springboard - the other great hobby projects of Mark Lindner, both gave
a significant contribution. Also, it includes a number of other packages I've been experimenting with 
and some prototypes too.
