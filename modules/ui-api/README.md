# Workspace UI API

This package contains classes to use with the Workspace UI when building the dynamically loaded plugins for the
Desktop.

Desktop uses the same mechanism to load plugins for itself as with which it was loaded itself. This is the default implementation of what is described in the [API documentation](https://github.com/grauds/clematis.desktop/blob/master/libs/api/README.md#workspace-user-interface).
